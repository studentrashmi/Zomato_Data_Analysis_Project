In this project, 
I conducted an in-depth analysis of Zomato's restaurant and customer data to uncover key insights and trends. Through data visualization techniques like heatmaps and pivot tables, here’s what I discovered:

Restaurant Popularity: 50% of customers prefer ordering from Casual Dining restaurants, while Quick Bites accounts for 30% of orders.
Customer Engagement: 60% of total customer votes are received by Casual Dining, showing high customer interaction with this category.
High Ratings: Around 40% of restaurants are rated between 4.0 and 4.5, indicating strong customer satisfaction.
Online Orders Dominate: A significant 70% of customers prefer placing orders online, showcasing a clear trend towards digital food delivery.
Offline Offers: Bars and Fine Dining see more offline orders, accounting for 40% of all offline transactions, suggesting a potential area for promotional offers.
Couples' Spending Habits: Couples tend to spend an average of ₹500 per order, making them a valuable target audience for marketing campaigns.
This project allowed me to hone my skills in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Python, while providing actionable insights for improving restaurant services and customer satisfaction.
